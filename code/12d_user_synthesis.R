displayed hereafter correspond to the user-defined parameters related to the biological sample selection
criteria, the type of data used in the analysis and the choices for algorithm training. They are common to all
considered species. The outputs are displayed at the species level, in form of graphical outputs for each pipeline
steps, and only including those passing the embedded quality checks. The graphical outputs provide information
concerning:
     - The biological and environmental data location, selection, and importance in the observations.
     - The environmental variable importance in the model training.
     - The spatial projections and uncertainties
     - The biological response to each environmental variable in form of partial dependency plots
Depending on the user selection, a selection of diversity projections across species can be displayed at the end
of this document. It only considers species passing the quality checks.

Please note that the Bluecloud2026 Ecosystem Workbench development team did its best to provide a habitat
modelling pipeline, including the latest advances and quality checks in this field of research, and quality
assessment guidelines to a large audience. The interpretation of the results and final quality assessment is up to
the user, however.")
