#' @name qc_recommantations
#' @description function to extract the recommendations according to a set of
#' predefined quality checks of the algorithms.
#' @param MODEL the model object returned by the projection step
#' @param DATA_TYPE the data type from the CALL object, 
#' as recommendations differ from one to another
#' @param ENSEMBLE compute the QC for the ensemble
#' @return a recommendation table with the quality checks and associated text
